# Training Improvements and Fixes

## Issues Fixed from training_output.txt:

### 1. Deprecated PyTorch AMP APIs
- **Fixed**: `torch.cuda.amp.GradScaler()` → `torch.amp.grad_scaler.GradScaler('cuda')`.
- **Fixed**: `torch.cuda.amp.autocast()` → `torch.amp.autocast_mode.autocast('cuda')`.

### 2. Token Sequence Length Issues
- **Fixed**: Sequence length (535,275) exceeding model maximum (1,024).
- **Added**: Proper sequence chunking with the `SequenceDataset` class.
- **Added**: `create_data_loader()` with a collate function for proper batching.
- **Added**: Maximum sequence length enforcement (64 tokens to match the context window).

## Major Training Enhancements

### 1. Extended Training Configuration
- **Epochs**: Increased from 2 to 200 for quality output.
- **Learning Rate**: Optimized OneCycleLR scheduler (1e-4 to 5e-4).
- **Batch Size**: Reduced to 16 for stability.
- **Optimizer**: Enhanced AdamW with better parameters.
- **Loss Function**: Added label smoothing and padding token ignore.

### 2. Comprehensive Logging System
- **File Logging**: Detailed logs are written to `training_output.txt`.
- **Progress Tracking**: Batch-level progress with percentages.
- **Performance Metrics**: Loss, learning rate, and gradient norms.
- **Memory Monitoring**: GPU memory allocation tracking.
- **Time Estimation**: ETA calculations for long training sessions.

### 3. Validation and Quality Control
- **Validation Split**: 10% of data is reserved for validation.
- **Early Stopping**: Patience-based stopping to prevent overfitting.
- **Best Model Tracking**: Automatic best model saving based on validation loss.
- **Sample Generation**: Periodic text generation during training to monitor progress.

### 4. Checkpointing System
- **Auto-save**: Checkpoints every 10 epochs.
- **Best Model**: Separate best model checkpoint.
- **Resume Training**: Full state preservation (optimizer, scheduler, scaler).
- **Periodic Saves**: Additional checkpoints every 20 epochs.

### 5. Enhanced Model Architecture
- **Sequence Handling**: Proper input/target sequence creation.
- **Gradient Clipping**: Prevents exploding gradients.
- **Mixed Precision**: AMP for faster training (if CUDA is available).
- **Memory Management**: Efficient GPU memory usage.

## Training Timeline
- **Expected Duration**: 8+ hours for 200 epochs.
- **Monitoring**: Real-time progress in `training_output.txt`.
- **Checkpoints**: Available every 10 epochs for early stopping if needed.
- **Sample Quality**: Improves significantly after epoch 50+.

## Key Files Modified
1. `modern_example_usage.py`: Enhanced training loop and logging.
2. `improved_helperAI.py`: Added PyTorch Dataset and DataLoader classes.
3. `training_output.txt`: Will contain comprehensive training logs.

## How to Monitor Training
```shell
# Monitor training progress
tail -f training_output.txt

# Check for checkpoints
ls -la checkpoint_*.pt

# Resume from the best checkpoint if needed
# (checkpoint loading code is included in the trainer)
```

## Expected Results
- **Early epochs (1-20)**: High loss, garbled output.
- **Mid training (20-100)**: Decreasing loss, recognizable patterns.
- **Late training (100-200)**: Low loss, coherent script-like output.
- **Final output**: Character-specific dialogue generation with proper Game of Thrones style.
