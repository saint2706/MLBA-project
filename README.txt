# Game of Thrones AI Script Generator Repository

This repository contains a project for generating Game of Thrones scripts using an AI model. The repository is organized into several branches, each serving a different purpose.

## Branch Overview

Here is a summary of the available branches and their purpose:

- **`main`**: This is the main branch of the repository. It is currently empty and serves as a starting point. This `README.md` file is located here.
- **`version1`**: This branch contains the primary, fully-featured version of the Game of Thrones AI Script Generator. It is a complete Python project with a modular structure.
- **`colab-version`**: This branch is a modification of `version1`, specifically adapted for use in Google Colab notebooks.

## How to Use Each Branch

### `version1`: The Main Project

This branch contains the full project for the Game of Thrones AI Script Generator. It is designed to be run on a local machine.

**Features:**
- A sophisticated neural network for script generation.
- Detailed documentation and usage instructions in its own `README.md`.
- Scripts for training, data preprocessing, and visualization.

**How to use:**
1. Check out the `version1` branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout version1
   ```
2. Follow the instructions in the `README.md` file on that branch to set up the environment, install dependencies, and run the project.

### `colab-version`: For Google Colab

This branch is designed for users who want to run the project in a Google Colab environment. The entire project is consolidated into a single Python script for ease of use in a notebook.

**Features:**
- A self-contained script with all necessary code.
- Instructions for setting up and running in a Colab notebook.

**How to use:**
1. Check out the `colab-version` branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout colab-version
   ```
2. Navigate to the `Colab` directory.
3. Upload the `main.py` file to your Google Colab environment.
4. Follow the instructions within the `main.py` script to install dependencies and run the cells. You will also need the `Game_of_Thrones_Script.csv` dataset.
